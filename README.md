# OSC.Ninja
Remote control web-based wrapper for OBS.Ninja; now Companion compatible.

### Still in early development

To enable OSC at the moment, you can host your own websocket server and issue commands to the wrapper, using osc.ninja as a coding reference. I'll try to get some server code up for UDP-OSC support at some point. In the meantime, there is some sample third-party OSC server code here, supporting UDP to Websockets: https://github.com/colinbdclark/osc.js-examples/tree/master/browser

A REST-API version should be something I'll be able to add in the near future as well; for now, websockets though.

I'm investigating how to best integrate with Companion still.
